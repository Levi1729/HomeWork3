# HomeWork3

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate three approaches for retrieving and re-ranking search results from a CSV dataset. The goal is to provide users with the top 5 relevant search results using advanced techniques in natural language processing and information retrieval.

## Project Structure

The project is structured around three Jupyter notebooks, each implementing a different approach:

1. **Semantic Search Results (Semantic_Search.ipynb):** This notebook demonstrates how to use semantic search techniques to retrieve relevant search results.

2. **Combining Semantic Search, BM25, and Re-ranking (IRTM_Retrieve_Re_Rank_BM25.ipynb):** This approach combines semantic search with BM25 and re-ranking strategies to refine search results.

3. **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) (IRTM_HM3_RAG.ipynb):** This notebook uses the RAG technique to augment the retrieval process with generated information, aiming to enhance the relevance of search results.

## Installation

To run these notebooks, you need to have Python installed on your machine (preferably Python 3.7 or later).

1. *Clone the Repository:*

bash
git clone https://github.com/Levi1729/HomeWork3/tree/main
cd Homework3


2. *Install Dependencies:*

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt


The requirements.txt file should list all Python libraries that your notebooks depend on, including but not limited to numpy, pandas, torch, transformers, and any specific libraries used for semantic search or BM25 implementation.

3. *Launch Jupyter Notebook:*

bash
jupyter notebook


Navigate to the notebook you want to run and follow the instructions within.

## Usage

Each notebook is designed to be self-contained, with step-by-step instructions along with commands on how to use the implemented approach to retrieve and rank search results from a CSV dataset. 

- Ensure your CSV dataset is formatted correctly and accessible to the notebooks.
- Follow the instructions in each notebook to input your search query and obtain the results.
